If you run linux I would recommend just executing the executable file main. You can compile it by yourself, but you should have sdl2, sdl2_image, sdl2_ttf, and sdl_mixer to do it. But if you do have them just type:

`make`

terminal and it should compile everything.

If you use windoes tho, that main.exe files does not work (at least it didn't work on the windows system I tried on), you please watch some youtube tutorial on how to properly set sdl file and install a C compiler and compile it.
